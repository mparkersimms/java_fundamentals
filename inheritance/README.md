# Lab 06 Inheritance 

This lab was geared toward creating multiple classes, relating 
to each other, and creating Interfaces of the classes in order to 
implement certain features of one class to another. 
In this lab, I created a Restaurant Class and a review class, 
and then an addReview Interface that is called in the 
Restaurant Class as an inheritance. 

# Lab 07 Inheritance
This lab was about adding some additional classes to the repo. A Shop class, and a Theater
class. The Theater should also contain a list of movies that are playing at the 
theater. The reviews are added to each of those classes as well as an ability to 
add and remove movies from the list of movies at each theater. 

## How to test the code

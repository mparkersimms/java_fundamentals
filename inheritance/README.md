# Lab 06 Inheritance 

This lab was geared toward creating multiple classes, relating 
to each other, and creating Interfaces of the classes in order to 
implement certain features of one class to another. 
In this lab, I created a Restaurant Class and a review class, 
and then an addReview Interface that is called in the 
Restaurant Class as an inheritance. 

## How to test the code 
 Tests are built in to the package and can be located here
